      <h3>
        Thank you for showing interest in this Household Labour Survey, which is being conducted by a team of researchers from Indian universities, consisting of Dr. Shubhro Sarkar (IGIDR), Dr. Shamim S. Mondal (NMIMS), Dr. Rajendra Prasad Kundu (JNU) and Dr. Prithviraj Guha (Presidency University).
      </br></br>
      The purpose of this survey is to study how various members of Indian households have changed the way they spend their time as a result of the lockdown, which was put in place to fight the Coronavirus pandemic.
    </br></br>
    There are no risks in participating in this research beyond those experienced in everyday life. The time needed to complete the survey depends on household size, and takes approximately 6-8 minutes per household member. We encourage respondents to fill in the questionnaire on the desktop version of a browser rather than the mobile one.
  </br></br>
      The Survey
        <ul>
          <li>will be repeated once more when the lockdown will not be in effect</li>
          <li>is not a study done by any Government agency</li>
          <li>will not collect or share any personal details about you with anyone, and we will only ask for your email address to be able to contact you for a follow-up survey later. (Your information will be assigned a code number that is unique to this study.)</li>
          <li>will not allow anyone to identify you or any member of your household, as the findings of our study will only be reported in the aggregate.</li>
          <li>will not be used for any commercial purposes.</li>
        </ul>
      </br></br>
